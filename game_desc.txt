Game Basics
-There are 5 colors: orange, brown, green, blue and yellow
-There are 5 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
-The board is a 5×5 grid (25 tiles total)
-Each tile has one color and one number(e.g. square half of a dominoe)
-The player starts with a random arrangement of these tiles

How Matching Works
-The player can click one tile and drag it over others to remove them if they are matching tiles
- A tile is a matching tile if it has the same color or same number of the dragging tile
- If any tile is matched during a drag, the clicked tile is also removed
- The goal is to clear the board
- When the board is cleared next level is generated and presented to the user
- The maximum number of times the board is cleared before the game is over is the score of the player
- The game is over if there exists any tile which cannot be cleared in the board

Level Generation
-Level generator builds levels that are always solvable.

Level generation logic with repetition allowed
==============================================
gen is routine that places a random tile from 25 possible tiles
match-color-tiles will generate all possible tiles with the tile color given as argument.
match-number-tiles will generate all possible tiles with the tile number given as argument
combine is the routine which forms a set out of the results of match-color and match-number routines, comine happens inside set
pick is the selection of one matching tile from the result of combine
the result is that tile generated by the gen can always 
be eliminated by the tile selected in the pick.

example:
gen: 1, orange 

match-color:
1, orange
2, orange
3, orange
4, orange
5, orange

match-number:
1, orange
1, brown
1, green
1, blue
1, yellow

pick:
1, yellow



ALGORITHM
//the idea is to generate a random tile and generate its matching tile
for 12 times do
	set.clear()
	genTile = gen()			  
	set.add(match-color-tiles(genTile))
	set.add(match-number-tiles(genTile))
	//match-color and match-number will always have a common element
	pickTile = pick(set)		
	level.tiles.push(genTile)
	level.tiles.push(pickTile)
end for

//last tile(25th tile) must be the matching tile of 
//any of the 24 tiles generated so far
set.clear
for each tile in level.tiles
	set.add(match-color-tiles(tile))
	set.add(match-number-tiles(tile))
end for
lastTile = pick(set)
level.tiles.push(lastTile) 

//shuffle for difficulty
level.tiles.shuffle()

game.addLevel(level);

MATHS
=====
MAXIMUM TILE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 24 TILES=
25^12 * 9^12

last tile must be the matching tiles of 
any of the 24 tiles generated so far
MAXIMUM TILE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 25th TILE = sigma_1_to_24(9)

TOTAL ARRANGEMENTS = MAXIMUM TILE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 24 TILES * MAXIMUM TILE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 25th TILE
